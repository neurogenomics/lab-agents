# Lab-Agents

A shared AI coding-agent environment for the Imperial College London Neurogenomics lab, with integrated access to Labstep (lab notebook), OneDrive/SharePoint (shared data files), and local data analysis tools.

Compatible with any agent that supports the [Agent Skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) standard — [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), [OpenCode](https://github.com/opencode-ai/opencode), [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), and others.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- An AI coding agent CLI (e.g. [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), [OpenCode](https://github.com/opencode-ai/opencode), [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot))
- [APM](https://github.com/microsoft/apm) installed
- Labstep API key

### Setup

1. Clone and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/neurogenomics/lab-agents.git
   cd lab-agents
   apm install
   ```
2. Add your Labstep API key to `.env`:
   ```bash
   LABSTEP_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```
3. Launch your agent from the repo directory and ask what skills are available.

## Skills

### 1. labstep

Query experiments, protocols, inventory, and other entities from the Labstep electronic lab notebook (read-only).

```
> Show me the last 10 experiments
> What protocols are linked to SK543?
> Search for experiments mentioning "lysis buffer"
> List all resources tagged "antibody"
```

### 2. labstep-sentiment

Summarise key findings and researcher thoughts from Labstep experiments.

```
> Summarise findings from all experiments in January 2026
> What were the key results from the IVT optimisation experiments?
> Give me a research summary across all lysis buffer experiments
> Export experiment summaries to Excel
```

### 3. nucleic-acid-analysis

Read and extract RNA quantification data (Qubit, TapeStation, qPCR) from experiment folders on OneDrive.

```
> What are the Qubit concentrations for SK443?
> Show me the TapeStation results for SK134
> Compare RNA Qubit yields between SK443 and SK447
> Compare HiScribe vs RiboMax RNA yields across all IVT experiments
> Are there any TapeStation warnings or alerts in SK172?
> What are the TapeStation peak sizes for each sample in SK297?
```

### 4. read-from-sharepoint

Read-only access to lab data files from synced OneDrive (SharePoint) folders. Auto-discovers all Skene lab shared libraries.

```
> List all experiment folders in the scRNA-seq library
> Find the experiment folder for SK457
> What files are in the SK443 folder?
> Show me the Metadata.xlsx for SK297
```

### 5. experiment-summary

Generate a filled-in Experiment Summary `.docx` from Labstep metadata and OneDrive QC data. User-invocable via `/experiment-summary`.

```
> /experiment-summary SK443
> Write up an experiment summary for SK297
> Generate the experiment summary for "IVT kit comparison"
```

### 6. pptx

Generate and modify PowerPoint presentations from data or text.

```
> Create a slide deck summarising the IVT optimisation results
> Add a slide with the Qubit bar chart to my presentation
> Read the contents of results_deck.pptx
```
